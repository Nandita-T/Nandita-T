## About me
I am a Bachelor student in Electronics & Communication Engineering, focused on embedded firmware and PCB prototyping. I enjoy bridging software and hardware to solve practical problems and validating designs with data-driven methods.

## Skills
- Programming: Python, C, C++
- Web Dev: HTML, CSS, JS, Tailwind
- Embedded systems: Microcontrollers, firmware development
- Hardware & CAD: KiCad, PCB layout and design
- Data & analysis: Regression, statistics, experimental validation
- Tools: Git, basic oscilloscope and logic analyzer use, debugging workflows

## Current focus
- Learning and exploring
- Building and testing microcontroller-based projects
- Improving PCB manufacturability and layout in KiCad
- Applying regression and statistical analysis to test data and experiments

## Projects (to add)
- Firmware for microcontroller-based sensors (brief description, repo link)
- Small PCB prototypes for [project name] (brief description, repo link)
- Data-analysis notebooks for experimental validation (brief description, repo link)

(Provide project names and short descriptions and Iâ€™ll add them with links and badges.)
